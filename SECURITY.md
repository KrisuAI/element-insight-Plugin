# Security Policy - Element Insight IntelliJ Plugin

**Effective Date: January 2025**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Overview

Element Insight is built with **security as a fundamental principle**. This plugin operates entirely within your local environment with no external data transmission, ensuring maximum security and privacy protection.

## üîí Security Architecture

### **Local-Only Processing**
- **Zero Network Exposure**: No data leaves your machine
- **Local Execution**: All processing happens in your local environment
- **No Backend Communication**: Zero communication with external servers
- **Isolated Operations**: Each scan operation is completely isolated

### **Binary Security**
- **SHA-256 Verification**: All bundled binaries include integrity checksums
- **Source Transparency**: Rust binaries compiled from open-source code
- **No Obfuscation**: All code is transparent and verifiable
- **Regular Updates**: Binaries are updated with security patches

## üö´ Security Guarantees

### **What We Never Do**
- ‚ùå **Transmit Data**: No data is sent to external servers
- ‚ùå **Execute Remote Code**: No remote code execution
- ‚ùå **Access Sensitive Files**: No access to files outside your workspace
- ‚ùå **Network Monitoring**: No network traffic monitoring
- ‚ùå **User Tracking**: No user behavior tracking
- ‚ùå **Data Collection**: No personal or usage data collection

### **What We Do**
- ‚úÖ **Local Processing**: All operations happen on your machine
- ‚úÖ **File Isolation**: Only access files in your specified workspace
- ‚úÖ **Transparent Code**: All functionality is open and verifiable
- ‚úÖ **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 checksums for all binaries

## üîê Data Security

### **Local Storage Security**
- **Workspace Isolation**: Files are only created in your project directories
- **No Cloud Storage**: Nothing is uploaded or stored remotely
- **User Control**: You control where and what files are created
- **Temporary Processing**: Scan data is processed in memory, not stored

### **Configuration Security**
- **Local Settings**: All configuration stored locally in IntelliJ
- **No Sync**: No synchronization with external services
- **User Ownership**: You own and control all configuration data
- **No Backups**: We don't maintain any configuration backups

## üåê Network Security

### **Network Access Control**
- **User-Controlled URLs**: Only scans URLs you explicitly enter
- **Direct Access**: No proxy or intermediate servers
- **No Backend APIs**: Zero communication with KrisuAI servers
- **Playwright Only**: Network access limited to Playwright browser operations

### **Required Network Operations**
- **Browser Downloads**: Initial Playwright browser installation (one-time)
- **Web Page Loading**: Direct access to URLs you specify for scanning
- **No Data Transmission**: Zero data sent to external servers

## üîç Code Security

### **Source Code Transparency**
- **Open Source Components**: Rust binaries compiled from open-source code
- **Verifiable Builds**: SHA-256 checksums verify binary integrity

### **Local Processing Guarantee**
- **Your Machine Only**: All processing happens on your machine
- **No Cloud Processing**: No data sent to cloud services
- **No AI Training**: No data used for machine learning or AI training
- **No Third-Party Sharing**: No data shared with third parties

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### **Binary Integrity**
- **SHA-256 Checksums**: All binaries include integrity verification
- **Source Verification**: Binaries compiled from verified source code
- **No Tampering**: Checksums prevent unauthorized modifications
- **Regular Updates**: Binaries updated with security patches

### **Runtime Security**
- **Memory Isolation**: Each operation runs in isolated memory space
- **File System Isolation**: Limited access to specified directories
- **Process Isolation**: No access to other running processes
- **Network Isolation**: Limited network access to user-specified URLs
